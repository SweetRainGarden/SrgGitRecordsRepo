# SrgGitRecordsRepo - Git Bisect Test Record Repository for the [Bisect Tool Repo](https://github.com/SweetRainGarden/SrgGactionGittoolsRepo/actions)

## Overview
The `SrgGitRecordsRepo` serves as a test environment for demonstrating and validating the Automated Git Bisect GitHub Action. It contains a series of commits, including both good and bad ones, to simulate a project with a history of changes where specific commits introduce errors or bugs. It's a KMP sample project.

## Purpose
This repository is specifically designed to:
- Provide a realistic commit history for testing the Automated Git Bisect GitHub Action.
- Help users understand how bisecting works in identifying problematic commits.
- Serve as a reference implementation for setting up and running git bisect in a continuous integration workflow.
- [first bad commit in SrgGitRecordsRepo](https://github.com/SweetRainGarden/SrgGitRecordsRepo/commit/7abdb50f6b661a3e9039c3d4d315600da7b2729e), it should show up in the Action result summary, like this one: https://github.com/SweetRainGarden/SrgGactionGittoolsRepo/actions/runs/8410715233
## Usage
The `SrgGitRecordsRepo` is used as a target repository in the Automated Git Bisect GitHub Action. To test the action, you can specify this repository and its commits as part of the action's input parameters. 

## Repository Structure
- Contains a linear history of commits where certain commits are known to introduce faults intentionally.
- Commit messages or tags in this repository may indicate the nature of the commit (good or bad) to assist in testing the bisect process.

## Contributing
While this repository serves a specific purpose, suggestions for enhancing its utility for git bisect demonstrations are welcome.
